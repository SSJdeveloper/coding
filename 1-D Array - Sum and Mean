Sum and Mean



Given an array A[] of size N, containing positive integers. You need to print the sum and mean (floor value) of given numbers.
Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function:- SumAndMean() that takes the Array and the integer N as parameter.

Constraints:-
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= 100


code======

static void SumAndMean(int arr[],int N){
  //Enter your code here   
       int sum=0;
       for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
           sum+=arr[i];
       }
       System.out.print(sum+" "+(sum/N));
    }
