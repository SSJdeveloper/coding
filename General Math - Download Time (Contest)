Internet download speed is often expressed in bit per second whereas file size is expressed in Bytes. It is known that 1 Byte = 8 bits. Given file size in megabytes(MB) and internet speed in megabits per seconds(Mbps), find the time taken in seconds to download the file.
Input
The only line of input contains two integers denoting the file size in MB and download speed in Mbps.

1 <= file size <= 1000
1 <= download speed <= 1000
