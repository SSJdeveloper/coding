You are viewing the buildings from the left and can see the roof of a building, if no building to the left of that building has height greater than equal to height of that building.
You are asked the number of buildings whose roofs you can see.
Input
The first line contains N denoting number of buildings.
The next line contains N space seperated integers denoting heights of the buildings from left to right.


Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
1 <= H[i] <= 1000000000000000
