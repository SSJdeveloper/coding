Doctor Strange stumbles upon a rather curious artefact while spending holidays in Egypt. An antique board game but it can only be unlocked by a magical die. The only clue on the box is to get a sum of B by throwing the die A times. Help Doctor Strange if it is possible to get the particular sum. Print “YES” if it is possible, otherwise print “NO”.

Note:- Consider the die to be a regular one with face {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Input
The input contains two integers A and B separated by spaces.

Constraints:-
• 1≤A≤100
• 1≤B≤1000
A and B are integers.
